<p>Kumospace is an immersive video chat platform that allows people to mingle within a virtual event space. During Prospective Student Days, our social events will take place on Kumospace at <a href="https://www.kumospace.com/prospectives" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
<p>After logging in, you can move about the virtual room using your computer’s arrow keys. You will be able to hear the people close to you in the virtual space, and as you move away from them, their audio will fade out. This functionality will allow everyone to mix and mingle in different groups!</p>
<p><strong>Download link?</strong> None needed! Just follow the link above, and make sure you grant Kumospace permission to access your webcam and microphone.</p>
