<h1>Housing</h1>
<p>The university offers housing to graduate students for up to five years in apartment buildings near campus. There are several different kinds of units available, including apartment shares, studios, one bedrooms (for students who live with a spouse), and larger units (for students with children). For more specifics on the different kinds of units and eligibility, we recommend checking out <a href="https://residential.columbia.edu/content/students/accommodations" target="_blank">the Columbia Residential website</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a better sense of what itâ€™s like to live in Morningside Heights, several students in the program have created video tours featuring their Columbia housing. Please see below!</p>
