# Resources

During Prospective Student Days, we will use a few different platforms to facilitate your virtual visit. If you have any questions about how to use them, or if you experience any unforeseen technical difficulties, please don't hesitate to let us know!

Kumospace is an immersive video chat platform that allows people to mingle within a virtual event space. During Prospective Student Days, social events will take place at the event-specific Kumospace links found on [the Schedule page](/schedule).

After logging in, you can move about the virtual room using your computer's arrow keys. You will be able to hear the people close to you in the virtual space, and as you move away from them, their audio will fade out. This functionality will allow everyone to mix and mingle in different groups!

**Download link?** None needed! Just follow the event-specific Kumospace link, and make sure you grant Kumospace permission to access your webcam and microphone.
