Kumospace is an immersive video chat platform that allows people to mingle within a virtual event space. During Prospective Student Days, our social events will take place on Kumospace at [this link](https://www.kumospace.com/prospectives){target="_blank"}.

After logging in, you can move about the virtual room using your computer's arrow keys. You will be able to hear the people close to you in the virtual space, and as you move away from them, their audio will fade out. This functionality will allow everyone to mix and mingle in different groups!

Zoom is a video conferencing platform that allows for both one-on-one and group meetings. During Prospective Student Days, you will use Zoom to access most of your meetings.

Keep in mind that while the Zoom links for all group meetings are located on the [Schedule](/schedule) page, links to your individual meetings with faculty can be found in the email we sent you with your personal schedule.
