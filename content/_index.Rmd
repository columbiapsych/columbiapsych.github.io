## Individual Scientific Computing Support

---

Columbia University psychology graduate students can stop by to chat about using computing tools at any stage of the research process. Use cases include, but are not limited to:

- Conducting pre-study power analysis
- Setting up tools for administering tasks in-person and online
- Cleaning and analyzing data
- Preparing presentations and manuscripts

During the Spring 2021 semester, the [graduate methods support advisors](/who/) will be holding office hours by appointment. To schedule a time that works well for you, or for email support, please contact [psych-methods-support@columbia.edu](mailto:psych-methods-support@columbia.edu){target="_blank"}.

## Ongoing Meetings and Workshops

Our next workshop, *Creating Websites in Github and R*, is scheduled for February 10th, 2021, at 4 pm. For more information, visit the [Meetings](/meetings/) page.
