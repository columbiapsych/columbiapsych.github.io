<h2>Campus and Morningside Heights</h2>
<hr />
<p>Although Columbia University was established in 1754, it moved throughout New York City several times before settling in 1897 in its current location in Morningside Heights, which is nestled between the Upper West Side and Harlem in the borough of Manhattan. Schermerhorn Hall, the location of the psychology department, is one of the original buildings in this current location. To learn more about our department and the university, check out the following virtual tour!</p>

<h2>Housing</h2>
<hr />
<p>The university offers housing to graduate students for up to five years in apartment buildings near campus. There are several different kinds of units available, including apartment shares, studios, one bedrooms (for students who live with a spouse), and larger units (for students with children). For more specifics on the different kinds of units and eligibility, we recommend checking out <a href="https://residential.columbia.edu/content/students/accommodations" target="_blank">the Columbia Residential website</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a better sense of what it’s like to live in Morningside Heights (as well as off-campus in Brooklyn), several students in the program have created tours featuring their housing. Please see below!</p>
