      <description>Resources During Prospective Student Days, we will use a few different platforms to facilitate your virtual visit:
Kumospace  Kumospace is an immersive video chat platform that allows people to mingle within a virtual event space. During Prospective Student Days, our social events will take place on Kumospace at this link.
After logging in, you can move about the virtual room using your computerâ€™s arrow keys. You will be able to hear the people close to you in the virtual space, and as you move away from them, their audio will fade out.</description>
