      <description>Virtual Tour Campus and Morningside Heights Although Columbia University was established in 1754, it moved throughout New York City several times before settling in 1897 in its current location in Morningside Heights, which is nestled between the Upper West Side and Harlem in the borough of Manhattan. Schermerhorn Hall, the location of the psychology department, is one of the original buildings in this current location. To learn more about our department and the university, check out the following virtual tour!</description>
